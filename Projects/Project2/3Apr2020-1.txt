	The problem this paper tries to solve is creating evaluation metrics that can be used to analyze Threat Intelligence (TI) data as consistently as possible. The reason the authors wanted to do this is because a standard for TI evaluation does not exist or is not widely enforced, either because it is deemed too difficult to implement/enforce or because it's seen as unnecessary. To achieve the desired standard, the authors analyzed 47 distinct IP address TI sources and 8 distinct malware file hash TI sources. The authors helped create this standard by introducing 6 different evaluation metrics to determine how efficient a TI source may be - these are volume, differential contribution, exclusive contribution, latency, accuracy and coverage. The analyzing of the sources through these metrics revealed that there is little to no explanations as to why the sources are deemed malicious, some of the sources are either very quick at discovering malicious files/IPs or are very delayed in doing so, and each feed will have areas that they help more in than others (ex: feeds with low accuracy are better used when each indicator is manually checked by a human as opposed to being checked automatically by a program).
	One major strength of the paper is the way they present and document the data they collected; the charts and tables help visually display this data so that the sheer volume of data they are conveying is easy to comprehend. One weakness I had noted was that they failed to explain all the metric results on the data in a high-level manner within the conclusion section - they touched on a few high-level points concerning using the data metrics instead of more of what using the metrics on the data resulted in. If I had written the paper, I would have attempted to receive more malware file hash TI sources for more accurate results during the analysis with the provided metrics. One interesting way to extend the concepts within this paper would've been to contact the providers of the TI data they received and help them advertise the metrics on their sites - this would provide customers with an idea of how helpful the TI data will be for their needs while also helping standardize the use of these metrics globally.
