	The problem the paper tries to solve is whether browser security warnings are effective at discouraging users to proceed to malicious websites or not. The authors of this paper intended to do so by examining telemetric data collected by two popular browsers (Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome) and plotting the data to determine whether the most common browser security warnings had any effect on users decisions. The authors helped convey the data significance better towards the readers by presenting it within several graphs and providing supplemental screenshots of what the warnings looked like. The main data the authors were concerned about collecting is the clickthrough rates for each warning (i.e., the percentage of users that clicked through the warnings and proceeded to the possibly malicious sites anyways), but they also included data more specific to the operating systems the users are on, the types of warnings and how many users ignored them as well as how they differ between the two browsers. While there is opportunity for some biased data, it should not have effected the data that was collected, so the results should be relatively factual - they indicate that the majority of warnings are effective at dissuading end users from visiting malicious websites (all aside from the Google Chrome SSL warnings, which a whopping 70.2% of users clicked through).
	One of the major strengths of this paper is that the data is laid out very well so that readers can more easily understand it all - there are several helpful graphs and tables that help illustrate the differences between the data that was collected. One of the major weaknesses of the paper is the lack of browsers used in the experiment - the authors only included Firefox, Chrome and IE (and IE is only in some of the data comparisons) but left out other major browsers like Safari and Opera when collecting data. If I wrote the paper, I would've decided to include more data from mobile devices like Androids and iPhones which would help better illustrate the different statistics that arise from these environments (since differently-styled warning messages for mobile browsers could potentially change the way the user reacts). If the authors wanted to further extend the concepts presented in this paper, they could return and do another study for current times - this would help solidify reasons why users ignore the warnings as well as help invent better ways to present the warnings and help convey that a website has poor security practices or is malicious.
