	The problem the paper tries to solve is whether or not every browser and privacy-themed browser extension is subject to at least one type of bypass that could result in unwanted tracking or cross-site attacks. The authors created a framework that automatically evaluates cross-site countermeasures and anti-tracking policy implementations within browsers and used it to also evaluate browser extensions that are designed to protect against these attacks. Their findings complemented their original theory; every browser and privacy-oriented browser extension that was evaluated was ignorant to at least one attack that could potentially compromise the privacy of their users. The authors identified that these attacks consisted solely of cookies for one website ending up being referred in a request to another site (such as a tracking site used as an advertisement); this is dangerous because the third-party tracking website receives the cookie with (potentially) sensitive information, and can further refer it up the chain of tracking websites and use it to track browsing history to a specific user. The ultimate point of this article is that the framework that was created by the authors can help developers test whether or not these attacks can be constructed against their browsers or browser extensions.
	One strength of the paper is that the authors suggest various other ways to mitigate the problem; they suggest implementing same-site cookies so that the cookies are not sent in requests to other domains, and also suggest using these privacy-oriented browser extensions since it has been proven that they protect against a myriad of attacks and likely have accounted for cross-site attacks by this point. One weakness is that the authors did not show usage of their framework during the testing phase - screenshots would have demonstrated the product in use more efficiently than just describing how it worked in words. If I had written the paper I would have included screenshots of using the framework to test the browsers so that readers would have had a better understanding of how the testing was done. One interesting way the concepts in this paper could be extended is if it was revisited at a later time to see how browsers and browser-extensions improved to handle this type of attack.
