# Problem 1
Scenario: Physical - Head of the TSA

Assumptions: 
- I am in charge of setting the rules for screening passengers at airport checkpoints
- I am in charge of many employees and do not have any superiors that directly influence my work

Assets:
- Employees - The actual employees that will be enforcing the TSA rules at airports
- Ordinary Citizens - They are the main asset to protect from harm
- Planes - The planes are the second main assets to protect because they can affect human lives if tampered with
- Security Officers - They are responsible for investigating and intercepting possible threats to the public

Threats:
- Organized Crime Groups - Groups that will attempt to hijack, destroy or misuse a plane for personal reasons
- Mentally Ill People - People who could possibly cause physical harm to others or be dangerous due to mental illness
- Physical Illnesses - Physical illness outbreaks are potential in airports and on planes and could cause widespread harm to others
- Terrorism - Individuals or groups of people following a (usually political or religious) ideal that seek to cause terror amongst citizens of different countries
- Drugs - They can be smuggled through airports by people in various ways and can cause harm to the smugglers and the people that end up using them
- Explosive Devices - They can be smuggled in through airports to cause damage to airport equipment and planes while also hurting innocent people

Countermeasures to implement:
- Metal Detectors - Scan for metal objects in luggage or inside/on a person to help prevent unwanted materials from getting on board of planes
- Cavity Scans - Can detect illicit materials that may be inside of a person
- Heavy Surveillance - Can monitor every area of every airport and have a dedicated surveillance team to help spot and intercept threats
- Thermal Cameras - Can help with perimeter defense; allow "night-vision" by detecting heat sources

Countermeasures but not to implement:
- Drones - Can help eliminate threats alongside the perimeters of airports; it is a barbaric (and costly) countermeasure to implement for 24/7 surveillance at every airport


# Problem 2
Scenario: Digital - Managing the Email Server for a Major Presidential Campaign

Assumptions: 
- I am the only person managing the email server
- The presidential campaign I am working with is a large target for attackers
- There have been no attacks towards the email server as of yet

Assets:
- Email Server - The email server that must be protected from attacks
- Encryption - The encryption scheme that encrypts all sensitive information sent and received

Threats:
- Hacktivists - Attackers that are looking to exploit the email server for political activism
- Blackhat Hackers - Attackers that are looking to exploit the email server for their own financial gain
- Insider Attacks - Attackers that are working within the presidential campaign to attack from the inside

Countermeasures to implement:
- Keyscrambling Program - Program that scrambles keystrokes so that keyloggers cannot intercept information while it is being typed
- PGP Key Generating Software - Cryptographic public/private keys that can encrypt text before it is sent between two parties that are both using this software (so that emails cannot be read except by the two parties)
- VPN (Virtual Private Network) - Ensures internet traffic is routed through safe servers so that information cannot be read over the wire
- Strong Passwords - Passwords for the PGP keys, the email server and the VPN must be strong and strictly memorized
- HDD Encryption - Encrypts the HDD that has the email server software so that it can only be accessed by me
- Firewall Software - So that any malicious programs will not be able to interfere with the email server software

Countermeasures but not to implement:
- Background Checks on Employees - Can be used to determine if anybody working on the presidential campaign has a criminal background and could possibly be an Insider Attacker; however, it usually wouldn't detect these attackers


# Problem 3
Scenario: Digital & Physical - Protecting Nuclear Launch Code(s)

Assumptions: 
- I am somebody who has high-level access and a high-level knowledge of both physical and cyber security
- I do not know the nuclear launch code(s) nor do I have access to that knowledge
- The code(s) will only be known by a small group of people and can only be used by an even smaller group of people
- The defenses must be 100% solid so that attacks are NOT possible

Assets:
- Nuclear Launch Code(s) - This is knowledge that must be shared by highly trusted parties vocally or through 100% secure digital communications
- People with the Knowledge of the Code(s) - They must have both physical and digital security to protect them both from attacks, extortion and extremely high-level threats
- Place Where the Code(s) Can Be Used - (Hopefully) there is only one place where the code(s) can be used; it should be secured as much as possible and have extremely limited access

Threats:
- Nation-Level Threats - Entire nations could be threats because the possession of the code(s) would mean the ability to launch the nuclear bombs from OUR nation
- People with the Knowledge of the Code(s) - While they are the ones who are trusted with the code(s), they could also be potential threats if they were to give out the code(s) to unauthorized parties
- Extortion - If attackers possess knowledge of the personal lives of those that know the code(s), they could try to extort the code(s) from them by trying to attack them personally

Countermeasures to implement:
- Rotate the Code(s) - The code(s) could be changed on an hourly or daily basis to prevent attackers from using them; if the code(s) change often than knowledge will not do anything without quick physical access to using them
- Heavy Physical Security where the Code(s) Could be Used - By providing heavy physical security on the (hopefully one) place the code(s) can be used, it could only be accessed by people that have been pre-authorized and deemed trusted enough to have this high level of access
- 100% Secure Encryption - Necessary for if the code(s) are shared digitally; at the least, it is necessary for the machine that generates the code(s) for storage and accessability purposes

Countermeasures but not to implement:
- 24/7 Surveillance of Parties That Know the Code(s) - The parties likely cannot be trusted to be without (at least almost) 24/7 surveillance to ensure that the code(s) are not shared with unauthorized parties, but this is unlikely to be implemented (however, the parties should still be under constant heavy surveillance)
